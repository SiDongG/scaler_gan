## Description
This is an implementation of an algorithm that allows users to select arbitrary non-overlapping regions of duration of any spoken content, and speed up or down each audio region by a corresponding scaling factor of users' choosing, without altering other speech characteristics such as pitch, amplitude, etc. 

This implemention is based on [ScalerGAN](https://github.com/MLSpeech/scaler_gan) and [Hi-Fi GAN](https://github.com/jik876/hifi-gan/tree/4769534d45265d52a904b850da5a622601885777)

## Steps
1. Follow instruction in [ScalerGAN](https://github.com/MLSpeech/scaler_gan)
